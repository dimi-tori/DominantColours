# DominantColours
A program that uses k-means clustering to find dominant colours in an image and displays the resulting image using only those dominant colours. The inputs are an image, the number of colours, and the maximum number of iterations before the program stops and returns the result.

## Limitations
- Runs quite slowly, not recommended to use on large images
- The starting point for each mean is randomized, leading to some colours being overlooked or the output having less than k colours
